## Quickstart

### Controls
- Movement: W/A/S/D
- Look: keyboard only — yaw with Q/E, pitch with I/K
- Rotate: Q/E
- Zoom FOV: Mouse Wheel or +/-
- Zoom monitor scale: R
- Possess/Release: Tab (toggle possession)
- Emergency release: Esc

### Notes
- The Operator Console uses a SubViewport monitor bound to the drone camera.
- SubViewport is fixed at 640×360 with UPDATE_ALWAYS and CLEAR_MODE_ALWAYS.
- If the feed is black, ensure a valid `Drone` exists and its `Camera3D` is current.
